            <h3 class="space-bottom-lg space-top-lg">Content and Linking</h3>
            <p>
                If you're approved, we hereby grant to you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use or display
                our name, logo, URL and trademarks on your website. You acknowledge and agree that such license is limited and that all
                right, title, ownership and interest in our name, logo, URL and trademarks shall remain with JobLane at all times.
                You cannot modify any banners or images provided to you by us. The Affiliate is solely responsible for their sites and all 
                linking code. All links are subject to our approval. We monitor affiliate traffic and sites for compliance to these terms.
                If we determine the Affiliate is no longer in compliance, they will be notified via email and their account can be
                deactivated pending further investigation. It is the Affiliate's responsibility to ensure they are in compliance with these
                terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you fraudulently add leads or clicks or inflate leads or clicks by fraudulent traffic generation, as determined solely
                by us, you will forfeit your entire commission for all programs with us and your account will be terminated. It is the
                obligation of the Affiliate to prove to us that they are not committing fraud. We will hold your payment in 'Pending
                Status' until you have satisfactorily provided evidence that you are not defrauding the system. Termination notice will be
                provided via e-mail and will be effective immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not register Job Seekers through the links on your site for your own use, for resale or commercial use of any kind.
                You may not require visitors to register with you before being redirected to JobLane.
                You may carry advertising around job listing content provided by JobLane. 
                However, no advertising may be used that covers all or part of the body of JobLane content.
            </p>

            <h3 class="space-bottom-lg space-top-lg">Commissions</h3>
            <p>
                </p><div>
                    We will pay you a commission for job seeker registrations and for employer registrations as outlined below.
                </div>
                <div class="space-top-sm">
                    For Job Seeker Registrations - We will pay referral fees for each valid job seeker registration with a valid CV,
                    referred by you, for a visitor who clicked through your affiliate link and successfully registers on the JobLane
                    website. A valid job seeker registration must be completed by your referred visitor and must fill a valid CV on our
                    website. Duplicate or fraudulent entries, as determined solely by us, are not eligible for any commission, may be
                    removed and the transaction may be reversed. Commission is a one-time payment per customer for job seeker registrations.
                </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                For Employer packages - We will pay referral fees for each valid employer who purchase a recruiting package from 
                JobLane, referred by you, for a visitor who clicked through your affiliate link, successfully submitted, and paid
                for, their recruiting package. Any commission due may be adjusted for packages that are cancelled or payment was not
                received by us.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that you will be solely responsible for all applicable taxes, levies or duties, or any other fees or withholdings
                of any kind related to commissions earned by you under this Agreement.
            </p>

            <h3 class="space-bottom-lg space-top-lg">Commissions Schedule</h3>
            <p>
                Commissions are paid monthly, for services that have been paid in full and were not cancelled, providing you have at least
                $200 due to you. For any month your commission is less than $200, the balance will be carried over to the following month.
                We will pay a commission for job seeker registrations and recruiting packages placed within the cookie life of 30 days,
                unless the customer makes a purchase after clicking on another affiliates link or a link or advertisement placed by
                JobLane. The Commission rates are subject to change at any time, in our sole discretion, without notice, however we
                will make a reasonable attempt to notify you of the change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookie life begins when a user clicks your affiliate link and enters our site. Commission is only payable if it can be
                tracked to you with your affiliate id. We cannot track referrals for users who do not accept cookies or if they delete our
                cookie.
            </p>

            <h3 class="space-bottom-lg space-top-lg">Modifications</h3>
            <p>
                We may modify the terms of this agreement at any time, at our sole discretion. Either a notice of agreement change, or the
                new agreement, will be posted on our website. Publication of such notice or an email notice shall be considered sufficient
                notice of any changes. If you continue to participate in this program 48 hours after any such change you agree to these new 
                terms. If you disapprove of any new terms in this agreement, your only recourse is to terminate this agreement as outlined
                above.
