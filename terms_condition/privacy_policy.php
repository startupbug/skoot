                        JobLane is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal data
                        collected at this website. This statement summarizes the policies of this
                        website regarding the collection, use, and transfer of your personal data,
                        and the security measures  JobLane employs to protect such data.
                     </p>
                     <h4 class="text-regular">The Information We Collect</h4>
                     <p>
                        We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different
                        from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy.  JobLane and its affiliates are
                        the sole owner of information collected on this website.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        JobLane reserves its right to share your personal
                        information with its licensees and affiliates.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        JobLane is an online recruitment service and collects a variety of personal
                        data necessary to provide these services. By choosing to enter your personal
                        information on this site you indicate your willingness to disclose this information
                        to  JobLane and employers registered with it, and to be considered, when
                        appropriate, for one of  JobLane's vacancies. If you do not wish to disclose
                        this information,  JobLane will be unable to provide you the services offered
                        by this site, since employment, educational, and other personal information is
                        necessary in order to assess your employment opportunities.

                     <p>
                        It is not  JobLane's policy to seek any sensitive information through our website
                        unless legally required for recruitment purposes. Sensitive information includes data
                        relating to race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs,
                        trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, or criminal record.
                        We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do
                        wish to provide sensitive information for any reason,  JobLane accepts your explicit
                        consent to use that information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy or as
                        described at the point where you choose to disclose.

                     <p>
                        In order to present you as a candidate on a vacancy, your personal information may be
                        provided to  JobLane's clients (potential employers), affiliates, and licensees. If you
                        do not wish to participate in this service and benefit from the career opportunities that 
                        GulfTalent provides, please do not enter your personal information into the website.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Information obtained by the site is used only for the intended purposes stated. It is
                        JobLane's policy not to sell or share your personal information for related or unrelated
                        purposes to non-licensee third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.
                        If at any time we decide to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the
                        time it was collected, we will endeavour to notify you and give you a choice as to whether or
                        not we use your information in this different manner. No notification and choice will be sought
                        if  JobLane is compelled or required by applicable law, statute, regulation, ordinance, or
                        court order to disclose personal data.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Your personal information may also be used anonymously and in the aggregate in order to put
                        together industry, marketing and employment statistics. Used in this matter, your personal
                        information becomes non-identifying.  JobLane also monitors IP addresses for security purposes,
                        trend analysis, site administration, user movement tracking, and broad demographic information
                        gathering for aggregate use. The IP address of the computer you use to access  JobLane
                        (the 'internet street address' of your computer) is not linked to any personal information you
                        provide on the site.

                        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy of data and ensure proper use of
                        information,  JobLane has put in place appropriate physical, electronic
                        and managerial security procedures to safeguard all information collected online.

                        is outlined in the Privacy Statement, and will use our best efforts to ensure that
                        data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use. We also will
                        use our best efforts to protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

                     <p>
                        JobLane may offer newsletters to registered users of the site via email. If you wish
                        to unsubscribe from a newsletter, please follow the directions at the bottom of the
                        newsletter and you will be taken off the recipient list. If you thought the email you
                        have received from our server is an unsolicited email, please contact us at
                        <a href="mailto:abuse@JobLane.com">abuse@ JobLane.com</a> and we will follow up the matter.

                     <p>
                        JobLane will periodically send you website update information and service announcement
                        updates via email. Because these announcements contain important information about
                        JobLane's service, as long as you remain a registered user, you will not be able
                        to unsubscribe from these announcements. From time-to-time the site requests information
                        from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is your
                        choice and is completely voluntary as to whether to disclose information. Information
                        requested may include contact information and demographic information. Contact information
                        will be used to notify and award winners. Survey information will be used for purposes
                        of monitoring, improving, or enhancing the use and satisfaction of the site.

                        Policy applies solely to information collected by this website. This Privacy Policy does

                        the privacy policies of each and every website including those that collect personally

                     <h4 class="text-regular">Cookies</h4>
                     <p>
                        Cookies are packets of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive. At
                        JobLane, cookies allow us to keep track of the areas of the site you visit
                        and thereby offer you easy access to the information you find most relevant. They also
                        allow us to greet you by name when you visit and to remember that you have already registered.
                        No secure information or information about your personal identity is ever contained within
                        our cookies. Your web browser is most likely set to automatically accept cookies, but you
                        can consult your browser help file if you wish to change these settings. If you elect not
                        to receive cookies, registered users will not be able to view a personalized home page,
                        and will view the default homepage instead.
                     </p>
                     <h4 class="text-regular">Resume Privacy Options</h4>
                     <p>
                        When you post your resume,  JobLane automatically creates a registration for you using
                        the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the site in the future
                        you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        JobLane recognises that job seekers have different levels of comfort in posting their
                        resume on the internet. To accommodate the needs of all users,  JobLane offers three levels
                        of privacy from which to choose from.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Standard Posting gives job seekers the most visibility to the broadest employer and/or recruiter
                        audience possible, making the resume including full name and contact details searchable by all
                        third-parties who have subscribed to  JobLane’s database search service.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Private Posting will allow the resume to be searched, without the name or contact information
                        being displayed. In this case, interested parties can only contact the candidate through  JobLane.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Hidden Posting allows the user to post his/her resume on  JobLane without permitting it to
                        be searched by third parties. In this case, the resume can only be viewed by a third-party if
                        the candidate applies for a vacancy advertised by that third-party. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        In addition,  JobLane distinguishes between ‘Employers’ and ‘Recruitment Agencies’ and
                        allows users to specify their desired privacy and visibility options vis-à-vis each group separately.
                     </p>
                     <h4 class="text-regular">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
                     <p>
                        JobLane reserves the right to modify or amend the Privacy Policy at any time and for
                        any reason. Please check back to this Privacy Policy from time to time to stay informed.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Nothing contained in this Privacy Policy is intended to create a contract or agreement 
                        between  JobLane and any user visiting the site or providing identifying information
                        in any form. If you have any questions about your personal information
